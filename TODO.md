- createa src -> dist structure
  - so we can be more opinionated in how to structure the src, not be bound by .agent, .claude agent folder conventions
  - so we can export to different conventions

- Think about how we should "link" between documents (so they also work after build?) make sure there is all valid links between docs
- Make sure name references between files etc make sense
- make sure that we are not duplicating content beween files (at least not too much)
- all the markdonw files of dockit should follow the style guide too
