  "description": "Notifications display brief, contextual messages to inform users about system status, user actions, or important updates. They typically appear temporarily and can convey success, error, warning, or informational states to provide immediate feedback without disrupting the user's workflow.",
  "usage": "Notifications should be used sparingly and strategically to communicate important information that requires immediate user attention. Use notifications carefully because they catch the user's attention and disrupt their workflow.\n\nAvoid using notifications for information that doesn't require interrupting the user or isn't relevant to their current task. When notifications with irrelevant information are sent too frequently, users become distracted and annoyed, causing notifications to lose their impact.\n\nKeep messages concise and actionable, ensure proper timing and placement, and provide clear next steps when user action is required.\n\n### Where to position a notification\n\nHistorically a lot of our applications and sites have placed notifications in the same container as the main content. Often times this is not desirable as this causes unwanted layout shifts and pushes the content that the user is interested in (the main content of the page) outside of the viewport. Ideally the notification would be floating in the bottom right of an application where it does not disrupt the normal content flow.\n\n### When to use\n\n*   Provide immediate feedback after user actions that aren't immediately visible on the interface\n*   Communicate changes in system or application state that affect the user's workflow\n*   Alert users to information that requires their attention or response within a specific timeframe\n*   Confirm completion of background processes or long-running operations\n\n### When not to use\n\n*   Information is already clearly displayed and accessible elsewhere on the current page\n*   Content is promotional, marketing-focused, or not directly related to the user's current task\n*   The information can wait until the user's next natural interaction with the relevant feature",
