  "description": "In-page navigation is a navigational component for exploring content within a single page. Users can scan the page structure, jump directly to sections, and understand their current position as they scroll.",
  "usage": "In-page navigation is intended for pages with structured, section-based content where users benefit from an overview of the page and quick access to specific sections.\n\nThe in-page navigation can either apply to a full page after the [Hero](/hero) or be manually scoped to specific sections.\n\nWhen used at a full-page scope, only one instance is allowed per page. When manually scoped, multiple instances may be used as long as their scopes do not overlap. \n\nFull-page and manually scoped instances cannot be used together.\n\n### Component structure\n\n*   The component is structured around section headings within the page.\n*   Headings in the [Hero](/hero) section are excluded from the in-page navigation.\n\n### Usage scope\n\n*   The component can be used for an entire page or manually applied to specific sections or groups of content.\n*   When a full-page scope is used, only one component is allowed per page.\n*   When scoped to specific sections, multiple components may be used.\n*   *   There is an option to add a [Heading](/in-page-navigation#anatomy) on top of the in-page navigation component, which can be helpful in cases where the in-page navigation targets specific sections\n    *   When multiple manually scoped components are used, their scopes must not overlap.\n\n### Component placement\n\n*   It is placed after the [Hero](/hero) section and applies only to content that follows the [Hero](/hero).\n*   On initial load, the component position is fixed.\n*   As the user scrolls, the component transitions to sticky positioning once its container reaches the domain/bubble navigation boundary (24px below on desktop).\n*   When scoped to specific sections, it starts with the first section and remains sticky until the last section scrolls out of view.\n*   Large screens: The in-page navigation is positioned in the left two-column rail.\n*   Smaller screens: The component spans the full screen width.\n\n### Anchor scroll offset\n\nThe scroll anchor offset ensures that the target section heading remains fully visible after in-page navigation interactions. It is determined by whether the domain/bubble navigation is sticky and by the screen size.\n\n**Sticky domain/bubble navigation**\n\n*   Desktop: 80px\n*   Mobile / Tablet: 120px\n\n**Fixed domain/bubble navigation**\n\n*   Desktop: 24px\n*   Mobile / Tablet: 72px",
