  "description": "Radios are used to select a single option from a group of mutually exclusive choices, commonly found in forms, settings, and preference panels. Unlike [Checkbox](/checkbox)es which allow multiple selections, radios ensure only one option can be selected at a time within each group.\n\n",
  "usage": "Radio buttons are ideal for presenting 2-7 mutually exclusive options where users need to see all choices simultaneously to make an informed decision. Always provide a logical ordering such as frequency of use, alphabetical arrangement, or importance, and ensure labels are clear and follow parallel structure. Avoid negative phrasing when possible, and never use a single radio button in isolation – they must always appear in groups. For required fields, include a sensible default selection, while optional radio groups can start with no selection.\n\nRemember that unlike [Checkbox](/checkbox)es which allow multiple selections, radio buttons enforce a single choice within each group and typically require explicit confirmation through a save or submit action.\n\n### When to use\n\n*   Single selection from 2-7 mutually exclusive options\n*   When all available choices should be visible at once\n*   For decisions where users benefit from comparing options side-by-side\n*   In forms where explicit confirmation is required before changes take effect\n\n### When not to use\n\n*   For yes/no or binary on/off states (use [Checkbox](/checkbox) or [Switch](/switch) instead)\n*   When multiple selections are needed (use [Checkbox](/checkbox)es)\n*   For large option lists with 8+ choices (consider [Select](/select))\n*   For settings that should apply changes immediately (use [Switch](/switch))\n*   For single standalone options (always group radio buttons)",
