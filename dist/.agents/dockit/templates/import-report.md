## Source material

| # | Source | Type | Summary |
| :- | :----- | :--- | :------ |

## Inferred discovery

- **Name**: {inferred name}
- **Category**: {construct or concept}
- **Type**: {documentation type}
- **Tier**: {tier}
- **Primary consumers**: {designers, developers, content writers}
- **Key use cases / questions answered**: {inferred from content}
- **Benchmarking notes**: {if any benchmarking content was found, or "none identified"}

## Multi-document flag

{If the source material appears to cover multiple distinct topics that would warrant separate documents, describe them here and recommend the user consider splitting. Otherwise: "No — the source material maps to a single document."}

---

## Content mapping

How source content was mapped to sections.

| # | Section | Mapped | Source | Rationale |
| :- | :------ | :----- | :----- | :-------- |
| 1 | {section-name} | yes / no | {source # and location within it} | {why this content maps to this section, or why the section has no match} |

---

## Unmapped content

Source content that could not be mapped to any section in the chosen documentation category.

| # | Source | Location | Content summary | Recommendation |
| :- | :----- | :------- | :-------------- | :------------- |
| 1 | {source #} | {section/paragraph} | {what the content covers} | {discard, revisit later, or include in a specific section} |

{If all content was mapped: "All source content was mapped to sections."}

---

## Section state rationale

Why each section was assigned its state.

| # | Section | State | Rationale |
| :- | :------ | :---- | :-------- |
| 1 | {section-name} | draft / pending | {e.g. "Content exists but is incomplete — covers X but not Y" or "No source content addresses this section"} |

---

## Gaps and recommendations

{Summary of what is missing from the source material. Highlight sections marked as `pending` and any areas within `draft` sections where the content is thin. Suggest what the user should focus on when they continue with `/dockit:start`.}
