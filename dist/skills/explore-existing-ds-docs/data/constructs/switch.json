  "description": "A switch allows users to instantly change between two states (on/off, enabled/disabled). It provides immediate visual feedback and is commonly used for settings, preferences, or features that can be activated or deactivated with a single interaction.",
  "usage": "Switches are used for immediate, binary actions that take effect instantly without requiring a save or submit action. When a user toggles a switch, the change is applied immediately and the system responds in real-time. This instant feedback makes switches ideal for turning features on or off, enabling or disabling functionality, or changing modes where users expect to see immediate results. Unlike [Checkbox](/checkbox)es, which typically accumulate changes to be submitted as part of a form, switches represent independent actions that stand alone and update the system state immediately upon interaction.\n\n### Determining Checked vs Unchecked States\n\nWhen deciding which option should correspond to the checked (right/blue) or unchecked (left/gray) state, follow these principles:\n\n### Checked state (right/blue) should represent:\n\n*   The active, enabled, or \"on\" state\n*   The more permissive or open option (e.g., \"Public\" over \"Private\")\n*   The enhanced or additional functionality (e.g., \"Automatic\" over \"Manual\")\n*   The state that adds features or capabilities\n*   The option that increases visibility, access, or activity\n\n### Unchecked state (left/gray) should represent:\n\n*   The inactive, disabled, or \"off\" state\n*   The more restrictive or closed option (e.g., \"Private\")\n*   The default or basic functionality (e.g., \"Manual\")\n*   The state that removes or limits features\n*   The option that decreases visibility, access, or activity\n\nWhen in doubt, frame the switch label as an action or feature that can be enabled, making it clear that checked = activated. For example, instead of \"Private/Public\", use \"Make profile public\" where checked means public.\n\n### When to use\n\n*   For binary settings that take effect immediately (e.g., \"Enable notifications\", \"Dark mode\")\n*   When changes are independent of other form fields and don't require submission\n*   When the action is easily reversible with the same control\n\n### When not to use\n\n*   In forms that require a submit button to save changes\n*   For selecting multiple options from a list (use [Checkbox](/checkbox) instead)\n*   When the action requires additional confirmation or has significant consequences\n*   When the state change depends on other form validation\n*   If the change cannot be applied immediately due to system constraints\n*   For binary choices that are part of a larger form submission workflow",
