  "usage": "The code component displays code, commands, and technical language that requires distinct visual treatment. This includes programming languages, domain-specific languages such as search syntax, terminal commands, file paths, and configuration values. Code uses a monospace font to distinguish it from human language, which uses the default text style.\n\nThe component appears most often within paragraph text but can also be used in lists, [Table](/table)s, and other structured content.\n\n## Inline code\n\nUse inline code for short, simple references within the normal text flow, such as commands, function names, or configuration keys. Keep inline code concise. Long expressions or multi-part statements should use a code block instead.\n\n## Code blocks\n\nUse code blocks for code spanning more than one line or when single-line code benefits from separation from surrounding text.\n\n### Wrapping and overflow\n\nCode blocks can either wrap long lines or allow horizontal overflow with scrolling.\n\nPrefer horizontal overflow when:\n\n*   Code is meant to be copied and executed exactly as shown\n*   Indentation carries syntactic meaning, such as in Python or YAML\n*   Content is diagnostic, such as log output with column-based formatting\n\nPrefer wrapping when readability matters more than preserving exact formatting, such as illustrative pseudocode or conceptual examples.\n\n## Presenting code effectively\n\nIntroduce what the code does before showing it. After presenting code, explain what the user should notice or learn. Maintain proper indentation within code blocks.\n\n## When to use\n\n*   To display programming code, terminal commands, or domain-specific languages\n*   For technical values that should be interpreted literally\n*   To present executable snippets users may copy\n\n## When not to use\n\n*   For regular prose or human-readable text\n*   For emphasis or stress (use bold or italics instead)",
